            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is obſerved by <hi>Edmond Howes</hi> a diligent Compiler of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries Annals, That in this Iſland there hath happened five remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable alterations, and each of them alwayes about the period or revolution of five hundred years, whereof in his Hiſtorical Preface, he gives this inſuing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt alteration, ſayes he, was preſently upon the death of <hi>Gorboduc,</hi> ſeventeenth in deſcent from <hi>Brute,</hi> Founder, according to him, of the Britiſh Monarchy. This <hi>Gorboduc</hi> had cauſed his youngeſt Son <hi>Porrex</hi> to be joyntly crowned with his eldeſt Son <hi>Ferrex:</hi> Theſe two fall at difference among themſelves; the younger kills the elder, him the Mother, her the Multitude, hence Civil Wars; at length <hi>Malmutius Danwallo</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> having ſubdued all Competitors, tranſlates the Kingdom to another line, which continues without any memorable interruption, untill</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond grand alteration, in the Reign of <hi>Caſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beline,</hi> forty fourth Succeſſor of <hi>Malmutius,</hi> begun by the invaſion of <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> General of the Romans in <hi>Gaule,</hi> but not perfected before <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperors time, from which date the Aera or computation of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans abſolute Dominion here is to commence, who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e departure, recalled by their Domeſtick diſſentions, and Forein inundations, carrying with them alſo the ableſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60649:4"/>
of the Britains, was the occaſion of</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third famous alteration; for the Britains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of their own proper ſtrength, and deſtitute of the accuſtomed aid of their Champions the Romans, were neceſſitated to implore the aſiſtance of the Saxons, a people of <hi>Germany,</hi> againſt the Picts and Scots, who grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly infeſted the Northern borders.</p>
            <p>To theſe Saxons <hi>Vortigern,</hi> the late elected King, and Author of theſe Strangers imployment, in contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſervice, moſt improvidently allots, firſt the Iſle of <hi>Thannet,</hi> then all <hi>Kent,</hi> afterwards more to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit; beſides his mariage with <hi>Rowena</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> one of their principal leaders, gave them ſo firm a footing, that they not only could not be removed, but even forced their Landlords the Britains into the leaſt, moſt deſart, and moſt mountanous parts, whilſt theſe new intruding gueſts injoy the greateſt, the beſt, and richeſt ſhare, which they portioned into an Heptarchy, or ſeven petty Principalities, who contending among themſelves for ſuperiority, and wearying out one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with mutual diſcord, adminiſtred opportunity unto</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth, and indeed a twofold alteration, (but in regard of its immediate connexion is reckoned but as one) firſt by the Danes, a people likewiſe of <hi>Germany,</hi> who after many conflicts obteined the Soveraignty, but did not long retain the ſame. But the ſecond (which took its original almoſt, where the other determined) and chiefeſt mutation, both for its continuance and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality, was that by the Normans, a Nation prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily iſſued out of <hi>Normandy,</hi> but then poſſeſſing the South of <hi>France,</hi> who introduced a general innovation in all things but Religion, which alſo ſuffered its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitude or turn in</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fifth and laſt alteration under <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, who gave the firſt blow unto it, by his with-drawing his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60649:4"/>
obedience from the Romiſh Sea, in whoſe communion <hi>England</hi> had perſevered ſince its firſt converſion, and by ſuppreſſing Monaſteries who were the main Pillars and Supporters thereof. But his Son <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds further to the abolition of the Rites and Doctrine of that Church, which were yet again reſtored by his Siſter <hi>Mary,</hi> and again excluded by her Siſter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who was therein imitated by her Succeſſour, <hi>James,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyner of the two ſeparated Kingdoms, <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which our Author makes a parcel of this laſt alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and where he concludes his general Hiſtory of the ſeveral revolutions of this Iſland, from the firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a Monarchy here, untill the time wherein he wrote.</p>
            <p>But ſince there hath happened another alteration no leſſe, if not in ſome reſpect more conſiderable than any of the former, when not only the Perſon but the Office, not only a King, and that in an unparalleld manner, but even Kingſhip it ſelf was deſtroyed, (a deſign that was never ſo much as attempted by our Anceſtors) and inſtead thereof, an unheard-of kind of Common-wealth erected, which was ſoon ſuppreſſed by an inſolent Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, who thought under a different title to have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the whole power to him and his; But by Gods providence, and the perfidiouſneſſe of his own Relations, his purpoſe was defeated, his Son dethroned, a ſhadow of a Common-wealth retrived, once more diſmiſſed, again revived, and finally diſſolved, the old Government renewed, and lawfull Heir recalled; and all this came to paſſe within the ſpace of twelve years, yea moſt ofit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the circuit of one year, whereof we can only ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, This is the Lords doings, it is marvelous in our eys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly, if we conſider things impartially, there is great cauſe of admiration; that God ſhould not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60649:5"/>
among us for ſo many ages a Monarchy, (the beſt of Regiments in general, and in particular moſt agreeable to the ſituation of this Country, and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people,) but even continue it, maugre all the Plots and policies of men to the contrary, in that very blood and Family, which as far as creditable Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy will extend, hath been firſt known to have been inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there-withall.</p>
            <p>For we may ſafely affirm, that our preſent King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, (in whoſe poſterity we truſt it will remain as long as the Sun and Moon endures) deduces his pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in an indiſputable line, from all that ever did or could pretend a title or intereſt to the Crown, which we think can hardly be verified of any Prince beſides, this day in the Chriſtian world.</p>
            <p>For proof whereof we appeal to ſuch of our Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles only as are undoubted and beyond exception. Paſſing by therefore the Catalogue of Britiſh Kings from <hi>Brute</hi> to <hi>Caſſibeline,</hi> not as altogether untrue, but as very uncertain; paſſing by thoſe likewiſe we find mentioned during the Romans abode here, whoſe cuſtom it was to permit native Kings indeed in their Conquer'd Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but only as inſtruments of Tyranny, and wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the authority of the Empire and its Prefects: We ſhall take our riſe from the Saxons rule, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at that time, when from a multiplyed Eſtate it grew towards an Union; And yet we cannot omit one paſſage we find Recorded of <hi>Cadwallader</hi> laſt King of the Britains on this ſide <hi>Severn;</hi> who at his death propheſied that his Race ſhould recover the Dominion of this Iſle again, which was fulfilled in the dayes of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, and more compleatly of King <hi>James,</hi> as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear when the ſeries and progreſſe of the Story doth bring us thereunto.</p>
            <p>The Saxons, as hath been already hinted, made a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venfold
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60649:5"/>
partition of the Land they had wreſted from the Britains, but the Kingdom of the Weſt-Saxons (whoſe firſt ſtone was laid by <hi>Cerdic)</hi> did ſo increaſe in ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure, that in the end it overtopped all the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ina,</hi> the fifth deſcendent of <hi>Cerdic,</hi> was the firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancer of it to this prehemenency; but he dyed without iſſue, and the due order of the ſucceſſion was ſomewhat diſturbed, by the intruſion of four or five one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of the Blood-Royal indeed, but not in ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquity, as was <hi>Egbert</hi> Nephew but once removed from <hi>Ina,</hi> of whoſe right and promiſing forwardneſſe, <hi>Britric,</hi> the laſt of the Uſurpers, had ſo quick a ſenſe, that he contrived the deſtruction of young <hi>Egbert:</hi> Which to avoid, he was enforced to retire unto the Court of <hi>Offa</hi> King of <hi>Mercia</hi> or <hi>Middle England,</hi> but finding ſmall ſecurity there in regard his Enemy had married <hi>Offas</hi> daughter, he eſcapes thence into <hi>France;</hi> whence after the Tyrants death, he returns to the enjoyment of that Kingdome, which had been ſo long, and ſo unjuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from him.</p>
            <p>This Prince (which we the rather note becauſe of the affinity he hath with the Condition of our Sovereign that now is) had by an exiles experience attained ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of prudence, and all other perfections, that he much improved the Weſt-Saxon Empire, which was now well near arrived to its Meridian and heighth, when it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a moſt terrible Ecclipſe by the interpoſition of the Danes, who made their firſt irruption in his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors dayes; and though they were valiantly reſiſted, and frequently repulſed by him and his Succeſſors; yet did they never after ceaſe from afflicting one part or other, till they had reduced the whole to their ſubjection, in which poſture they held it but a little while, as hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been intimated, and ſhall be more amply ſhewed in its due and proper place.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60649:6"/>
               <hi>Egbert</hi> being dead, <hi>Aethewolph</hi> his Son of a Biſhop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Prince, and though his Education and Profeſſion had rendred him a greater Votary than Warriour, yet did he give the Danes a moſt memorable overthrow. He had four Sons, who were all Kings in their turns, but the glory of the reſt was <hi>Alfred,</hi> the youngeſt, no leſſe famous for Arts than Armes; in the firſt his Son <hi>Edward</hi> ſurnamed the Elder, is reported to have been inferiour, but in the laſt did equal, if not exceed his renowned Father.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Edward</hi> often worſted, but could not totally extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the Danes, who rcruited with freſh ſupplies from their own Comntry, made daily more and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments upon the already-tired Engliſh Nation, whoſe caſe at that time eſpecialy required ſome ſtrong prop or ſtay to ſuſtain and keep up its declining and tottering eſtate.</p>
            <p>And upon this account it was that <hi>Athelſtane Edwards</hi> baſtard Son, being at full maturity and ripeneſſe, was preferred before his legitimate one <hi>Edmond</hi> then in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority (the reaſon alſo that ſome ſucceeding Princes were for ſome time laid aſide) but <hi>Edmond</hi> being now come to Age, after his Brother <hi>Athelſtanes</hi> death (the nobleneſſe of whoſe life recompenced the blemiſh of his birth) was admitted to his Fathers Throne, which he did wiſely and couragiouſly manage, but was too ſoon deprived of it, and his life together, by a villanous Affaſſinate, in his own houſe at a feſtival, whilſt he went about to reſcue his Sewer from the violence of that barbarous hand.</p>
            <p>The more than ordinary hopes conceived of this brave Prince being thus untimely nipped in the bud, his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe-deſerving Brother <hi>Eldred</hi> was elected King, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>Edmond</hi> had left two Sons behind, whoſe tender years in thoſe troubleſome times were thought uncapable of ſo weighty an imployment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60649:6"/>
But upon the death of <hi>Eldred,</hi> the Scepter (which is a thing to be taken notice of in precedent and ſubſeqent ruptures of this nature) reverted to the right Heirs, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sons of <hi>Edmond:</hi> And firſt to <hi>Edwin</hi> the eldeſt, whoſe diſſolute and degenerate courſes made ſudden room for <hi>Edgar</hi> the youngeſt, who matched any of his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in worth, and excelled them all in power, for he quieted, and kept under, Danes, Welſh, Scots, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he is accounted, at leaſt from the Saxons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, the firſt abſolute Monarch of this entire Iſland.</p>
            <p>In a word, he was happy in his life, and Reign, but moſt unhappy in his Iſſue, for having two Sons, <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Ethelred,</hi> by ſeveral venters; the Step-mother <hi>Elfred</hi> made <hi>Edward</hi> a Saint to make her own Son <hi>Etheldred</hi> a King; and though now by this removal of his Brother, whereunto poſſibly he might not be privy, none had any nearer title to the Crown than himſelf, yet did that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood lye heavy upon him and his ſeed, nor could it, according to St. <hi>Dunſtans</hi> predictions, be expiated, but by a long avengement.</p>
            <p>In promoting of which divine juſtice, the Danes were the principal inſtruments, who had layn ſtill under <hi>Edgar,</hi> but taking advantage of <hi>Ethelreds</hi> unſettled condition, who by reaſon of this fore-ſtalling the Crown was termed the unready, forced him firſt to purchaſe an ill-kept peace, and then to relinquiſh his ill-gotten Kingdom, of which death only prevented <hi>Swayn,</hi> his expeller, to take actual poſſeſſion, and accumulate this to the Daniſh Crown.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Cnute</hi> the Son of <hi>Swayn</hi> perfected his Fathers deſign, and afforded <hi>Ethelred</hi> now returned out of <hi>Normandy,</hi> whither to avoid the ſtorm he had betook himſelf, ſo ſharp an entertainment that oppreſſed with grief for his bad ſucceſſe, he quitted this, and made another world his ſecond place of refuge, leaving his Son <hi>Edmond</hi> Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of little elſe, but the miſeries of an unfortunate houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:60649:7"/>
Yet did <hi>Edmond,</hi> for his valour, and hardineſſe in War, ſurnamed <hi>Ironſide,</hi> hew himſelf out with his Sword the moiety of a Kingdom. For after the effuſion of much blood on both ſides, and to ſtop the ſhedding, of more it was agreed between the two Competitors <hi>(Cnute</hi> and <hi>Edmond)</hi> to try their right by ſingle combate, in proper perſon, and the over-commer to take all. But there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving equality in the fight, there was likewiſe made equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the command between them; yet did not <hi>Edmond</hi> long enjoy his ſhare, being circumvented by the practice of <hi>Edric</hi> Earl of <hi>Stratton,</hi> the Arch-Traytor of thoſe times, whoſe falſhood had ruined the Father, and now his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition deſtroys the Son, for which <hi>Cnute</hi> invents a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reward, cauſing his head to be ſet upon the higheſt place of the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> therein performing his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of advancing him above any Lord of the Land, which was the mark that this faithleſſe wretch aimed at, and now attained, but in a far different ſence from that which he had vainly propoſed to himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cnute</hi> being thus rid of a Rival, denied copartnerſhip to the Sons of <hi>Edmond,</hi> as pretending the whole to apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Survivor, and for fear they might prove thorns in his ſide, he ſent them far enough out of the way, into <hi>Swedeland,</hi> ſay ſome, there to be murthered, but they were mercifully preſerved, and conveyed to the Court of <hi>Hungary,</hi> where <hi>Edmond</hi> dyed without iſſue, but <hi>Edward</hi> had by <hi>Agatha</hi> Daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> a Son named <hi>Edgar,</hi> and a Daughter called <hi>Margaret,</hi> who was the cauſe, as hereafter ſhall be ſhewed, that the Saxon ſtem which now ſeemed wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, doth once more reflouriſh, though inocculated we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, upon another ſtock.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this tranſportation of <hi>Edmonds</hi> Sons, yet did not <hi>Cnute</hi> hold himſelf ſufficiently aſſured of his new accquired Kingdom, till he had married <hi>Emma</hi> wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow

            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> ſtyled the Confeſſor, to diſtinguiſh him from <hi>Edward</hi> the Elder, and <hi>Edward</hi> the Saint, was next King, being the Son of <hi>Emma</hi> alſo, but by her firſt Husband <hi>Ethelred</hi> the Unready, and did in ſome ſort reſtore the Saxon blood: For in truth there was a nearer relation to the Crown extant, though not ſo near at hand for the preſent, to wit, <hi>Edward,</hi> ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by reaſon of his Forein education, the <hi>Outlaw,</hi> the Son of <hi>Edmond Ironſide,</hi> the eldeſt Son by his firſt Wife of the above mentioned <hi>Ethelred</hi> the Unready, who ought by the Law of Nature and Nations to have preceded. Yet did the Confeſſor, wanting Iſſue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, do his Nephew the <hi>Outlaw</hi> ſo much right, as to recall him with his Children out of their Baniſhment in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and deſigned him his Succeſſor, but the <hi>Outlaws</hi> death before the Confeſſors, prevented that determination.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe the Confeſſor without delay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>Edgar</hi> the <hi>Outlaws</hi> Son, and his own Grand Nephew Heir apparent, and gave him the ſurname of <hi>Etheling,</hi> which in thoſe dayes were only peculiar to ſuch as were inhopes and poſſibility of a Kingdome. And more than ſo, this poor <hi>Etheling</hi> never was: For
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60649:8"/>
firſt he was debarred by his own Guardian <hi>Harold</hi> the Son of <hi>Goodwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> who diſdaining the title of Regent (which he was only conſtituted) aſſumed that of King; Afterwards by <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> who though he pulled down <hi>Harold,</hi> yet did he not ſet up <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> laying claim himſelf to the Crown, by virtue of a pretended Donation from his Coſen <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, which had been too weak a plea, had it not been juſtified by a long ſword, which hath ever ſince given him the appellation of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert</hi> the eldeſt Son of the Conquerour ſhould by right of primogeniture have ſucceeded his Father in all his Dominions, but having proved a Rebel at the French Kings inſtigation, he had only the Dukedom of <hi>Normandy</hi> aſſigned to him, and the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was bequeathed to his Brother <hi>William</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Rufus,</hi> who dying without any legitimate off-ſpring, and <hi>Robert</hi> being abſent in the Holy-land, <hi>Henry</hi> the youngeſt Son of the Conquerour as Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> but eldeſt as King of <hi>England,</hi> ſeized upon it, and to ingratiate himſelf with the Natives, and to corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his Title, he Married <hi>Maud,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> by <hi>Malcolme</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Edgar Ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Outlaw,</hi> Son of <hi>Edmond Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,</hi> Son of <hi>Ethelred</hi> the Unready, Son of <hi>Edgar</hi> the peaceable Son of <hi>Edmond,</hi> Son of <hi>Edward</hi> Senior, Son of <hi>Alfred,</hi> and by which means the Royal ſeed of the Saxons became to be replanted in the Engliſh Soil.</p>
            <p>For this <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt had (not to mention his Son <hi>William</hi> who periſhed by water whilſt he was young) by the foreſaid <hi>Maud,</hi> a Daughter of the ſame name, whom he firſt eſpouſed to <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> afterwards to <hi>Jeffrey Plantagenet</hi> Earl of <hi>Aniou,</hi> by whom ſhe had a Son called <hi>Henry,</hi> in whom did fully concur the Norman and Saxon Race.</p>

But the true hereditary ſucceſſion was ſomewhat intercepted by <hi>Stephen</hi> Earl of <hi>Bologne</hi> Son of <hi>Adela</hi> the Conquerours Daughter, from whom he could derive but a ſlender title: For had the Conquerours line Maſculine failed, then ought <hi>Theobald</hi> Earl of <hi>Bloys, Stephens</hi> Eldeſt Brother by the ſame <hi>Adela,</hi> to have been prelated; And therefore his ſureſt Tenure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from his Election by the Nobility, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their natural Allegiance, and twice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Oath (and among them <hi>Stephen</hi> himſelf is reckoned to be one that had ſworn Fealty) to <hi>Maud</hi> and her Heirs in the Reign of her Father <hi>Henry,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this ſtranger, and that for no other reaſon, though other were alleged (as that <hi>Maud</hi> was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and conſequently uncapable of anointing; that ſhe was married out of the Realm, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereof, which if of any moment ſhould before their ſolemn engagement have been taken into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration) than that he being a Creature of their own erecting, was more obliged to them, and would upon all occaſions be more ready to gratifie their aſpiring humour.</p>
            <p>Yet wanted not the Empreſſe and her Son adherents both within and without the Kingdom, to aſſert their right, who raiſed ſuch a cloud of trouble to, <hi>Stlphen</hi> that he could not diſpel it during his whole reign, ſo that at length he came to a compoſition, and his own Son <hi>Euſtace</hi> whom he had deſigned his Succeſſour being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready dead, he adopts <hi>Henry</hi> fitz-Empreſſe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims him heir apparent, with this Proviſo; That he himſelf ſhould enjoy the Crown as long as he lived, which was not a full year after this peaceable agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond of that name is now poſſeſſed of the Throne, (in proceſſe of time adding the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

            <p>Firſt by vertue of the late Treaty with King <hi>Stephen,</hi> Secondly by title of conqueſt, as being great Grand-Child to <hi>William</hi> the Norman; but Thirdly, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the equity of his Mothers claim, who was the true deſcendent of the long-rejected but now reſtored Saxon linage.</p>
            <p>He took to wiſe <hi>Elenor,</hi> the repudiate of <hi>Lewis</hi> the ſeventh King of <hi>France,</hi> by whom he had large Dominions in that Kingdom: but notwithſtanding it augmented his eſtate, yet was it the occaſion of much trouble and vexation to him; For the French King jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his growing fortunes, and his own Queen of his fidelity to his marriage-bed, incited his Sons, <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Richard, Jeffrey,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> to frequent rebellions, to whom nevertheleſſe upon their ſubmiſſions he was entirely reconciled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> Sans iſſue departed this life before his Father. <hi>Richard</hi> ſucceeded in the Throne but dyed childleſſe alſo; <hi>Jeffrey,</hi> though extinct himſelf before it came to his turn, had yet left a Son in being, <hi>Arthur</hi> Duke of <hi>Britany,</hi> who ought to have been conſidered of; but him <hi>John</hi> prevented more too, by power &amp; favour of the Nobles, than by any colour of Juſtice, nad whilſt the young Prince endeavours the recovery of his right, he is taken priſoner as he beſieged the Caſtle of <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> conveyed to the Tower of <hi>Roan,</hi> and there killed, if not by the hands, yet at leaſt by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his inhumane Uncle.</p>
            <p>However the courſe taken to be thus rid of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor was utterly unlawfull, yet being gon, <hi>Iohn</hi> becomes the lawful proprietor of the Crown, but pays dear for the manner of this his amiſſe procured purchaſe.

            <p>Such this Prince <hi>Henry</hi> the third found his Subjects at his firſt admiſſion, whilſt he was governed by a wiſe and faithfull Councel, but afterwards ſuffering himſelf to be ruled by ſtrangers, that more intended their own than the publick good, he ſo alienated the Engliſh affections, as that they are as ready now to revolt from him, as they were earneſt at firſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his intereſt. To the former he adds new grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to wit, reiterated breach of Charters granted by his Predeceſſors, and himſelf, whence ſuch diſcontents are engendred, that at length there is begotten between the King and his people an actual (commonly known by the name of the Barons) war.

            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt of that name ſince the Norman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, having proved the deliverer of his Father from captivity, makes an expedition into the <hi>Holy-land</hi> to perform the like office to the Chriſtians there, that were grievouſly afflicted under the Turkiſh ſervitude: but the news of his Fathers death quickly recalls him from further proſecution of that honourable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; wherein he had no leſſe honourably demeaned himſelf.</p>
            <p>And as he had encreaſed his own and Countries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation abroad, ſo doth he likewiſe enlarge their power and juriſdiction at home, by ſubduing moſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and totally reducing of <hi>Wales,</hi> of which laſt, becauſe it was then firſt annexed to this Crown, it will not be impertinent to afford the Reader a brief and ſummary relation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wales</hi> (the ſmall remnant of this Iſland that was left to the Britains the antient poſſeſſors of the whole) had hitherto, though not without much difficulty and ſtruggling, continued under their own proper Princes: But the fatal period of their liberty, which they had ſo long, ſo ſtoutly maintained, againſt ſo potent a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as this, is now arrived. <hi>Llewellin</hi> the then Prince of that Country, being ſummoned to our Kings Coronation, refuſed to appear, ſaying, He too well remembers the end of his Father <hi>Gryffin,</hi> who came in ſafety to <hi>London,</hi> but never returned thence.</p>
            <p>This neglect, <hi>Edward</hi> makes the ground of a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, enters into hoſtility againſt <hi>Llewellin,</hi> forces him to a ſubmiſſion, whereof he ſoon repents, flyes out again, is overcome and ſlain in fight, his head cut off, and that <hi>Merlins</hi> Prophecy might be fulfilled or eluded, which, as he interpreted, had promiſed him the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem of <hi>Brute,</hi> it is Crowned with Ivy, and ſet upon the Tower of <hi>London.</hi>

After the death of <hi>Llewellin</hi> and his brother <hi>David,</hi> (whoſe head was ſhortly ſent to accompany the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the ſame place) <hi>Edward</hi> contrives the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual union of theſe two, too long divided, Nations. And though he found the Welſh Nobles very cautious how they brought their necks under a Forein yoke, yet doth he accompliſh his ends by this neat and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial deviſe.</p>
            <p>He conveys ſecretly into the Caſtle of <hi>Carnarvon,</hi> his Queen great with Child, whom when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be delivered of a boy, he Aſſembles the Welſh Nobles, and propoſeth to them, whether they would accept of a Prince of his Nomination, that was born in their own Country, could ſpeak nere a word of Engliſh, and againſt whom for Life or Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no objection could be made: Whereunto when they had aſſented, he produces his own little Son <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> to whom the aforeſaid qualifications did exactly agree; Hence the cuſtom took its original of inveſting our Kings eldeſt Sons in the Principality of <hi>Wales:</hi> but becauſe there may here ſeem to have been a mixture of force and fraud, we ſhall indeavour, when order brings us to it, to find out a more unexceptionable Title, whereby our Kings lay claim to that Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>

               <hi>Phillip de Valois</hi> the then King of <hi>France,</hi> had with ſomewhat too much rigour demanded, and with too much Imperiouſneſſe received the Homage of our <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> for ſome pieces which he held in that Kingdom. But <hi>Edwards</hi> high Stomach could not digeſt the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as he conceived of this humiliation, conſidering but ſomewhat of the lateſt, that he had a better right not to fragments only, but to the whole, than the perſon to whom he had ſo lowly abaſed himſelf: For <hi>Edward</hi> was the Son of <hi>Iſabell,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Philip le bell</hi> or the fair, formerly King of <hi>France,</hi> whereas <hi>Philip,</hi> the preſent injoyer, was Son to <hi>Charls</hi> of <hi>Valois</hi> but younger Brother to the foreſaid <hi>le bell,</hi> only there is one frivolous impediment in <hi>Edwards</hi> way, to wit, the French Law Salique, which debars Females &amp; their Deſcendents from the Crown: but this entail <hi>Edward</hi> is reſolved to cut off with a good Sword; And to this purpoſe he enters <hi>France</hi> with a ſtrong Army, and gave the French two ſuch famous overthrows at <hi>Creſſy</hi> and <hi>Poictiers,</hi> that they put that State into a dangerous Conſumption, which without all doubt would have turned to an Hectick Feavour, had the War been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted with the ſame heat wherewithall it was begun.</p>
            <p>A great allay to theſe proſperous proceedings, was the untimely death of <hi>Edwards</hi> eldeſt Son <hi>(Edward)</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> but better known by the name of the

Black Prince, to whoſe proweſſe the former Atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>France</hi> were chiefly owing, who having made an inroad into <hi>Spain</hi> to reinthrone their K. <hi>Peter,</hi> brought thence Victory and a mortal Diſeaſe, which quickly made an end of him, leaving behind him a young Son, <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Bourdeux,</hi> to whom <hi>Edward</hi> the Grand-Father, yet living, confirmed the ſucceſſion by Parliament, leſt his aſpiring Son <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster, Richards</hi> Uncle, ſhould<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as one obſervs, have ſupplanted him, as King <hi>Iohn</hi> did his Nephew <hi>Arthur</hi> in the like caſe.</p>

            <p>It will be no deviation from the matter, but rather requiſite in regard of the light it yields to the clearer and more diſtinct knowledge of the following confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to ſpeak ſomewhat more particularly of the manner of this <hi>Henryes</hi> compaſſing the Crown, the claim he laid to it, and the courſe he took to ſettle the ſucceſſion in his own houſe, this being the Fountain from which flowed the moſt bloody and moſt tedious Civil Wars that ever <hi>England</hi> endured, this being the great ball of contention between the White Roſe and the Red, between the Yorkiſh and Lancaſtrian Family.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of that name among the Engliſh Kings, was, as hath been noted before, the Son of <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> fourth Son of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third; His Father was ſuſpected, but he is detected, of higher thoughts than it became a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject (he being then but Duke of <hi>Hereford)</hi> to entertain.</p>
            <p>For juſtification of himſelf, <hi>Hereford</hi> appeals to his Sword, and offers combat to <hi>Thomas Mowbray</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> his Accuſer, who couragiouſly accepts

thereof: But as they were about to joyn iſſue, King <hi>Richard</hi> interpoſes and baniſhed them both, out of the Realm, <hi>Norfolk</hi> for ever, <hi>Hereford</hi> for ten years; four of which the King ſtruck off as of ſpecial favour, when he came to take his ſolemne leave of him. But <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> himſelf doth much more abbreviate the time, and doth long anticipates even the laſt indulged date of his return: For he re-lands the very ſame day twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month he departed, and found many Abettors of his quarrel (which at firſt he only pretends to be the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his Dukedom) eſpecially the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> whom King <hi>Richard</hi> at his late going into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where now he is, becauſe the Earl demurred to accompany him in the Voyage, had cauſed to be proclaimed Traytor, and ſo made him that, which otherwiſe perhaps he would not have been.

For it was obvious to all, however for fear diſſembled by moſt, that the iſſue of <hi>Lionel</hi> Elder Son of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, ought to have preceded <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunts</hi> the younger Son of the foreſaid <hi>Edward;</hi> And hence it was, that <hi>Henry</hi> doth not ſolely rely upon his Fathers right, which he knew to be infirm, as long as any of <hi>Lionels</hi> off-ſpring remained, but joyns to it that of his Mother <hi>Blanch,</hi> Daughter and Heir to <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,</hi> Son of <hi>Edmond,</hi> nick-named <hi>Crook-back,</hi> eldeſt Son, as was alleged, of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, but by reaſon of his deformity put by the ſucceſſion, which was for that cauſe conferred upon King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, though but the younger Brother; But the truth is, in this pedigree there is an Error in the very Foundation, for though our <hi>Henry</hi> were ſo deſcended as is ſpecified, from <hi>Edmond,</hi> yet the ſaid <hi>Edmond</hi> was neither eldeſt Son to <hi>Henry</hi> the third, nor yet a defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med perſon, but a proper Gentleman, and a great Commander, therefore entitled <hi>Crook-back,</hi> or rather

               <hi>Crouch-back,</hi> becauſe he had took upon him the Croſſe, and according to the Cuſtom of thoſe days warred in the Holyland.</p>
            <p>Thus appears the invalidity of <hi>Henryes</hi> claim, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Father, as unſound, or the Mother, as ſuſpitious, and deceitful, or from King <hi>Richard</hi> reced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as extorted by force in reſtraint, and ſo of no force, or of conſent of the many, there being no Cuſtom in the Engliſh Nation for popular elections, or by Conqueſt, which in a Subject againſt his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign is Inſurrection, and Victory high Treaſon, as was well obſerved by the Biſhop of <hi>Carlile</hi> in his ſpeech in that very Parliament, where this buſineſs was agitated and tranſacted.</p>
            <p>Nay further, there is a tradition, that <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> (Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this <hi>Henry)</hi> was not at all the Son of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> but that the Queen being deliver'd of a female child, knowing how unacceptable it would be to her Husband, exchanged it for a boy with a Dutch wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had been brought to bed about the ſame hour: This the Queen at her death confeſſed to <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> of <hi>Wickman</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> who acquainted none with i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

I <hi>Henry</hi> born at <hi>Monmouth,</hi> ſhall ſmall time reign and much get, and <hi>Henry</hi> born at <hi>Windſor</hi> ſhall long reign and loſe all.</p>
            <p>And ſo indeed it came to paſſe through the ſecret operation of all-diſpoſing Providence, which is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome propitious to the owners (how good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſoever they be) of ill-gained inheritances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the third ſucceſſion. And hereof our preſent <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth is a great example, who was the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt religious of all our Kings that had been before, and yet for no other tranſgreſſion that we know of, than the original Sin of his Grand-Father, <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, medling with the forbidden fruit of a Crown his ere it was ripe for him, is be chaſed out of the terreſtial Paradiſe of all his Kingdoms, and ſent to be a partaker of a Celeſtial one, ſomwhat more early than the due courſe of nature had deſigned him for it.</p>
            <p>For that covert fire which had a long time burned in the breaſts of many, to ſee the Lancaſtrian race enioy anothers right, doth now break forth into open com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion, of which <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> is the prime incendiary, the Son of <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who was beheaded in King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifths reign, for ſuppoſed Treaſon, the Son of <hi>Edmond</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the fifth Son of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third.</p>

            <p>Beſides his holding forth his claim to the Crown in this demonſtrative, and undeniable manner (which yet the judicious could only penetrate) the Duke ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth many Rhetorical aggravations, which were more ſuitable, and intelligible to vulgar ears; As that the King was ſimple, and of weak capacity; that he was Governed by the Queen a ſtranger, and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of an unſufferable ambition; that the Privy Counſellors were naught and corrupt, through whoſe faithleſſeneſſe and inabilities, <hi>France</hi> was loſt, and <hi>England</hi> diſquieted, and that greater judgements were to be expected, if the true Heir were any longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from his lawful right.</p>
            <p>The Duke by theſe plauſible arguments had ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the multitude unto him, that he is able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute his Title in the Field with the King, whom he takes Priſoner, and calling in his name a Parliament, it is there concluded, that King <hi>Henry</hi> during his life, ſhould retain the name and Honour of a King; that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> ſhould be Proclaimed Heir apparent to the Crown, and Protector of the Kings Perſon and Dominions; that if at any time King <hi>Henries</hi> Friends, Allies, or Favorites, in his behalf ſhould attempt the diſannulling of this Act, that then the Duke ſhould have preſent poſſeſſion of the Crown.</p>
            <p>But this was more than what his deſtiny had allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for him, for he was ſhortly after ſlain at the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of <hi>Wakefield</hi> by Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> who was of a more Maſculine Spirit, than to acquieſce in the fore-mentioned diſhonorable Conditions; and becauſe it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60649:15"/>
was a Crown that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> chiefly affected, She cauſed his Head to be cut off, ſee upon a Pole, and Crowned with Paper: but the death and diſgrace of the Father, <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> his Eldeſt Son doth ſpeedily revenge to the utter ruine of the Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrian party.</p>
            <p>Nor will this <hi>Edward,</hi> as did his Father, await a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers leaſure, and prove expectant of a Crown in reverſion, but immediately aſſumes it by the actual depoſing of King <hi>Henry,</hi> whom he takes Priſoner, and commits to ſafe cuſtody in the Tower of <hi>London.</hi>

The cruelty of <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was more crooked than his body, did not termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the blood of his Enemies, but begins to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe on his Friends and neareſt Relations: For per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that King <hi>Edward</hi> by reaſon of his incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whereunto no Engliſh Prince was ever more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, was not long liv'd, he ſecretly plots the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Crown for himſelf; And for the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite compaſſing this ambitious deſign, he firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſes King <hi>Edward</hi> againſt their common Brother <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> not only exaggerating the hainouſneſſe of his former diſobedience (which had been pardoned) but inſinuating a blind Prophecy, that one whoſe name began with the letter <hi>G.</hi> ſhould prove fatal to <hi>Edwards</hi> poſterity.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> is committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and there, by <hi>Richard</hi> drowned in a Butt of <hi>Malm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> however it was given out that he dyed of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented paſſion.</p>

            <p>Of this <hi>Henry</hi> there goes a tradition for current, that in the heat of the Civil Wars between the Houſe of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter, Henry</hi> the ſixth having eſpied him in the preſence, laid his hand upon his head, and in a Prophetick manner ſaid, Behold this youth, who is to enjoy that for which we now contend.</p>
            <p>Which his Mother obſerving, and treaſuring up in her heart, ſent him into <hi>Britany</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> as into a ſafe Harbour, to be there educated and preſerved till the fury of the tempeſt were over, which then did ſo terribly rage throughout the Land.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Richmond</hi> having much increaſed his Army among his Country-men, marches forward as far as <hi>Boſworth</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> where King <hi>Richard</hi> meets him, and there the great controverſy is finally decided in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail; <hi>Richard</hi> is ſlain, and <hi>Richmond</hi> by a kind of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary election ſaluted, and in a manner Crowned King in the Field.</p>

But as in a body, that hath been troubled with a Cronique Diſeaſe, though recovered, yet are there ſtill ſome peccant humours to be purged out: ſo, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this Union and Reconciliation, there remains dregs of diſcontents, whereof the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the ſuppoſed Parent, and <hi>Margaret</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Burgundy</hi> the known Nurſe; the firſt, becauſe ſhe thought her Daughter not ſufficiently reſpected (for King <hi>Henry</hi> is not accuſed to have been over uxorious or indulgent to his wife) the other, being Siſter of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, bore an endleſſe hatred to any of the Lancaſtrian Race.</p>
            <p>The firſt Spirit they raiſed to diſturb King <hi>Henryes</hi> quiet, was one <hi>Lambert Symnell,</hi> a ſtripling, but ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by <hi>Simon</hi> a Prieſt, who had higher directors, that he could well perſonate the young Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> (Son of <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence)</hi> whom the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Iriſh greedily entertain and acknowledge for their King: And when <hi>Henry</hi> to detect the forgery, had publickly ſhown in <hi>London</hi> the very Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> whom he kept his Priſoner, they retort the ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon himſelf, and give out he had ſuborned a counterfeit on purpoſe to delude the ſimple multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
            <p>But this Pageantry quickly vaniſhed, the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators are diſperſed, and <hi>Lambert</hi> taken, who had the honour to be firſt made a Turn-ſpit in the Kings Kitchen, but was afterwards preferred to be one of the Kings Falconers.</p>
            <p>This was but the Prologue as it were to a more deep contrived Comi-Tragaedy that was to follow, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the reſtleſſe Dutcheſſe of <hi>Burgundy</hi> was the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and one <hi>Perkin Werbeke</hi> the principal Actor. But the Name and Scene is ſomewhat altered: His Cue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him, is to play the part of <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:60649:18"/>
ſecond Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, who is feigned to have miraculouſly eſcaped the hands of his bloody Unckle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perkin</hi> was ſo good a proficient, and had learned, and could repeat his leſſon ſo exactly, that not the ſilly Iriſh alone, but the French, and Scotiſh Kings, with many of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> were, or would be deceived.</p>
            <p>Nay, Sir <hi>William Stanly</hi> himſelf, Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, the Kings eſpecial favorite, is ſo far trepanned, as to utter this improvident Speech (which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued high Treaſon) that if he certainly knew that the young man was the undoubted Son and Heir of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, he would never fight, or bear Arms againſt him; for which he became headleſſe, though he had been the chief help and ſetter of the Crown upon King <hi>Henryes</hi> head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perkin</hi> at length is taken, and committed to the Tower, where ſoliciting the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> to make an eſcape, he haſtens both his own merited, and that poor-Earls undeſerved execution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> having thus compoſed his affairs at home, ſeeks honourable matches for his children abroad; and marries his eldeſt Daughter <hi>Margaret</hi> to the Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh King, providently foreſeeing, that in caſe his iſſue Male failed, this conjunction might be a means to aſſociate the ſeparated Kingdoms, (as his own had the Roſes) and ſo remedy the inconveniences of two diſtinct eſtates in one ſingle Iſland.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arthur</hi> his eldeſt Son, Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> was eſpouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Katherine</hi> Infanta of <hi>Spain,</hi> but he dying before conſummation, we mean as to conjugal duty, his brother <hi>Henry</hi> by diſpenſation from the Pope, takes her to wife, who on the wedding day was attired

            <p>It is conceived that the young Prince (who hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward is to be ſtyled <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth) had never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great fancy to the Lady, as ſomwhat his Superiour in years, but did rather comply with his Fathers will, than his own inclinations: However for a long time he lived with her in an outward loving and ſeeming reſpectful manner.</p>

But the King had another, though not ſo deep a reach, which more concerned his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſatisfaction, than policy or reaſon of State.</p>
            <p>For he deſired to be unyoked from his old Queen, that he might make a new one of one of her maids of honour, <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Bolen,</hi> with whom he was deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately in love: which the Cardinal ſmelling out,

proves cold in the buſineſſe, delays to exerciſe his legantine power, inſtigates the Pope to recall the cauſe to himſelf, and proceeds ſlowly therein; all which is performed accordingly, but it concludes with the ruine of <hi>Woolſey's</hi> and the Popes Authority.

Conform whereunto <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after her death is proclaimed King of <hi>England,</hi> both which he converts into the name of Great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany;</hi> and now is <hi>Cadwalladers</hi> Prophecy, before remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, exactly compleated, that his Race ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſole Dominion of this Iſland; for King <hi>James,</hi> beſides his direct deſcent from King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, brought another, but higher title, if the former had not been ſufficient, from <hi>Banco</hi> a Nobleman of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe Son <hi>Fleance</hi> fled from the tyranny of <hi>Macbeth</hi> the Uſurper, into <hi>Wales,</hi> and there married the Prince his Daughter, by whom he had <hi>Walter</hi> the firſt of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Family of the <hi>Stewards:</hi> but for the particulars of that conjunction, we referre you to the Britiſh and and Scotiſh Hiſtorians.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> aroſe in this our Horizon with much clearneſſe, notwithſtanding <hi>Rawleighs</hi> miſt, and the ſmoak of the Gun-powder-plot, which were ſoon diſpell'd: but his ſetting was obſcured by a little Cloud which ſhortly did overſpread the whole Land.</p>
            <p>He had married his eldeſt Daughter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to <hi>Frederick</hi> Prince Palatine of the <hi>Rhene,</hi> who unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gaping after the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> loſt not only it, but his own patrimonial poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> who had more of <hi>Solomon</hi> than <hi>David</hi> in him, ſollicites reſtitution, rather by Treaty than Arms, and as the moſt conducing means to his peaceable ends, entertains an overture of a match betwixt his Son <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and the Infanta of <hi>Spayn,</hi> to whoſe King, the Palatinate was by the Emperour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned over.</p>
            <p>But the Engliſh Parliament takes exception at this intended Spaniſh affinity, and as if Religion were at the Stake, declaims againſt it; Notwithſtanding the King ſends his Son into <hi>Spain,</hi> who returns thence

without a wife. yet in his paſſage thither, had an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental ſight of her in <hi>France,</hi> who was by Heaven his deſigned Spouſe.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as <hi>Iames</hi> was dead, <hi>Charles</hi> his Son is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King, who immediately marries <hi>Henrietta Maria</hi> youngeſt Daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the great King of <hi>France,</hi> of whom, as was juſt now hinted, he had a tranſient view in his voiage to <hi>Spain,</hi> which when this Princeſſe underſtood, ſhe is reported to have ſaid, That he needed not to have gone ſo far for a wife.</p>
            <p>But now the ſeed of diſcontent, which had been ſowed in his Fathers time, did begin to bud forth; <hi>Scotland</hi> yields the firſt-fruits, which alſo too much thrives in the Engliſh P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For redreſſe of theſe imaginary grievances, the Scots with ſwords in their hand approach his Majeſty to preſent a Petition, as is given out<hi>:</hi> A Parliament in <hi>England</hi> is called to compoſe differences, which rather increaſes them, for which it is ſoon diſſolved: The Scots Invaſion continues, but at length a Pacification is made; another Parliament is convened, which working ſo far upon the Kings neceſſities, extorts from him an inſeparable jewel of his Prerogrative, to wit, a privilege, not before asked or granted, not to be diſcharged without their own conſent.</p>
            <p>In ſtrength of this conceſſion they proceed to other unſeaſonable demands, which together with the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults of the City, occaſioned the King to retire North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and being denyed entrance into <hi>Hull,</hi> (for which Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> did afterwards receive his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from thoſe that imployed him) he repairs to

            <p>The war continues doubtful for three years, but the Battail at <hi>Naſeby</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire</hi> proves fatal to the Kings affairs; for after that ſucceeds little elſe, but the ruine of his party in all places, and ſurrender of moſt of his Garriſons, till he was neceſſitated in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe to leave <hi>Oxford,</hi> his prime, and well-nigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone remaining hold, then in a manner beleaguered, and betake himſelf for Protection to the Scotiſh Army.</p>

               </gap>ough they had received all poſſible ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction as to their own concernments, yet could not refrain from intermeddling in the Engliſh diſtempers, and were at that time beſieging <hi>Newark</hi> upon <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They at firſt received the King with all ſeeming promiſes of ſecurity as to his Perſon, but having car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him with them to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> do there barter him with the Engliſh for 200000 <hi>l.</hi> a price, which, as the French Embaſſador obſerved, did far exceed that which <hi>Judas</hi> received for betraying of our Saviour.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Cromwels</hi> end in ſeizing on the Kings perſon, was not only for countenance of his Independent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt the oppoſite Presbyterian faction; but after their depreſſion the better to be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to deſtroy the King himſelf for his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement.</p>
            <p>For having once entrapped this Royal Lyon, he doth dayly more and more entangle him within his toyles, and never thinks him faſt enough, till he had got him in his pit-fall of the <hi>Iſle of Wight:</hi> whether he had allured the good King, who thought others as free from guile, as he knew himſelf to be, by ſetting before him the danger he was in, while he remained at <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Court, how he lay open and expoſed to the wicked machinations of the Agitators of the Army, who intended to Act that, which he poor Soul did even tremble to utter.</p>
            <p>But what the King hopes to find a tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sanctuary, proves to him a conſtant priſon, from whence he is not to be delivered but in order to his Tryal and Execution, the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of which fact, as we cannot, ſo neither need
